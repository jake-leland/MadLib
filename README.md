MadLib
======

Play Mad Libs with a computer.

The only thing that this program requires is a mad lib to read in.
This document must be in a particular format:
  The first line of the document must be the title.
  The second line of the document must be a number indicating the number of lines of the mad lib itself.
  The rest of the file is the Mad Lib.
    All of the blanks will be indicated by asterisks surrounding the type of blank.
    For example, if there is a blank that should be filled with a noun, the file will show *noun*
I have included a mad lib called "Computer Virus" as an example.

The computer will read through the file and pick out all of the blanks. It will ask you to fill in all of the blanks, then it will display the mad lib with all the blanks filled.
