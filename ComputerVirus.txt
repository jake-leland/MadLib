Computer Virus
17
I hate it when I'm working on an important *noun* and
suddenly my computer decides to *verb*. It's so
*adjective*! Last time, I was putting the finishing touches
on my final *noun* for my *noun* class when
*adverb* my computer screen went blank. I yelled
*exclamation* and almost started to *verb*. Luckily,
my dad works as a/an *occupation*, so he rushed right in and
helped me retrieve my lost *noun*. He said it happened
because of a computer virus that was *verb ending in "ing"* around
cyberspace. It was named *silly word* and was rumored to be
started by some *adjective* kids in *town*. Luckily,
he had had a software *noun* that will help protect my
computer against any nasty *plural noun* in the future. Isn't my
dad the most *adjective* dad ever?
